					<h3><a name="accom">Accommodations</a></h3>
					<p>
					From Hotels to camping, Paris boasts a wide range of accommodation for all budgets and all tastes. One way or another, it is useful to  weigh up the pros and cons of staying in central Paris, or staying further out from the centre, or even in the suburbs. 
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Staying in Paris</b>
							<p><span style="color:red">Advantages:</span> access, time. If you are only in Paris for a short break, staying centrally will allow you to spend more time seeing and doing things, and less time in trains, buses or taxis. </p>
							<p><span style="color:red">Disadvantages:</span> hotels near the tourist areas are generally quite expensive; cheaper hotels are often in less attractive areas of the city, far from the tourist sights and attractions, or else on the edge. And if you come to Paris by car, parking will be a major extra cost.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Staying outside Paris</b>
							<p><span style="color:red">Advantages:</span> hotels tend to be cheaper, and rooms may be bigger. If you choose a hotel that is near a train station, access to central Paris can be relatively easy and quick.</p>
							<p><span style="color:red">Disadvantages:</span> check that the cheaper room cost is not offset by the extra travelling costs - though remember that it is advisable not to take your car into town. Also, if you stay in the suburbs, you'll have less time to enjoy Paris by night. </p>

					<div id="restaurant">
					<p>
					There are thousands of restaurants to choose from in Paris; as well as plenty of French restaurants, there are hundreds of Italian restaurants, pizzerias, Vietnamese restaurants, and restaurants serving food from just about every country in the world.  There are also interesting French regional restaurants, serving traditional regional dishes.
					</p>
					<p>
					There are restaurants all over Paris, because Paris is very much a lived-in city. The best concentrations of top-class restaurants in Paris are near the Champs Elysees, in the 8th, 16th and 17th arrondissements, where there are a good number of Michelin starred restaurants. 
					For more affordable eating, and plenty of choice and atmosphere,  try the small streets in the Latin quarter (5th and 6th districts), or on the Ile St. Louis. 
					</p>
					<p>
					For the best oriental cuisine, go to the Paris Chinatown, south from the Place d'Italie in the 13th.

					<h3><a name="reason">Why Paris</a></h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">
					Paris, the ultra-cosmopolitan French capital city, has a long standing global reputation as a Mecca of art, culture, fashion, gastronomy, history and architecture. Called the City of Light, City of Love and Capital of Fashion, Paris is not only brimming with internationally famous attractions but is an energetic city where beauty and vivacity ever-weave its curvy streets. 
					Paris' starring role on the global stage makes it a prime destination for travellers, who have many reasons to visit beyond the emblematic Eiffel Tower and the world-renowned wines.
