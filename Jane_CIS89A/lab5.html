		<blockquote id="quotes">
			The only thing--I tell you this straight from the heart--that disgusts me in Salzburg is that one can't have any proper social intercourse with those people--and that music does not have a better reputation...
			For I assure you, without travel, at least for people from the arts and sciences, one is a miserable creature!...
			A man of mediocre talents always remains mediocre, may he travel or not--but a man of superior talents, which I cannot deny myself to have without being blasphemous, becomes--bad, if he always stays in the same place. 
			If the archbishop would trust me, I would soon make his music famous; that is surely true.<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
			- Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/22051.Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart)
